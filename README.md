# Creative-Coding-II

Welcome to my Repository for DATT3400 - Creative Coding II! This Repository contains all my Projects and Research & Development (R&D) documents for the course.

**Repository Organization**

To maintain clarity and organization, I have structured the Projects within separate Branches.  
The Projects Branch contains all the homework assignments, including their respective datasets and code.  
The Research-Development Branch contains my Research & Development Document Projects, including inspirations, coding experiments, and plans.

**How to Navigate**

Use the Branches dropdown menu above to switch between Branches.  
Each Branch contains dedicated folders and files for specific Projects with descriptions.

**About This Repository**

This Repository showcases my work in Creative Coding II, focusing on algorithmic thinking, generative art, and experimental coding techniques.  
Each Project explores creative approaches to coding, leveraging randomness, aesthetics, and interactivity.
